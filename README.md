Web application for Bus Transportation System in Tallinn


#Main file, transportation.php, db_connect.php and data.php

#I have developed a web application for the Bus Transportation System in Tallinn, Estonia. This application enables customers to view the current location of various modes of transportation, such as buses, trams, and trolley-buses. To gather real-time data from the public API, I implemented PHP code. I utilized Javascript to visualize and present the bus location on a map. Additionally, HTML was used to structure the website, CSS for designing the interface, and Mysql and PHP for the backend authentication process.  To access the application, customers must first register and subsequently log in to view the real-time location of transportation systems operating in Tallinn. This enhances the user experience by providing up-to-date information on transportation schedules and routes.
